# 📑 Welcome to Pycotech!

Pycotech offers tools and wrappers to interface with PT-104 PicoLog® Data
 Loggers and files, allowing you to easily build an end-to-end data processing
  pipeline in pure python.
  
This work would not have been possible without Martin Schröder's
 amazing wrapper around the usbpt104 c library for the Pico PT-104A RTD Data 
 Acquisition Module. Don't hesitate to head over his 
 [github repo](https://github.com/trombastic/Pico_PT104) to check out the
  original project and to drop a star! 🌟

## 🔥 Features

Pycotech's suite of utility functions provides seamless integration of
 `.PLW` and `.TXT` files generated by traditional PicoTechnology® software
  - allowing you to handle, visualise, and convert between data-formats at
   will. 
  
Pycotech also provides python command line alternatives to most of the 
 principal PicoLog® software components. Namely, pycotech's `plw-recorder
 ` allows you to bypass the PLW Recorder® data acquisition software and
  gather data directly from a number of PT-104 Data Loggers. Pycotech's `plw
  -player` substitutes instead the PicoLog® Player software, allowing you to
   read, convert, and extract data from existing `.PLW` files.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. 📚 Install pycotech like any other python package, using pip to download it
 from PyPI:

    ```cmd
        $ pip install pycotech
    ```

2. 🐍 Test your installation running the following minimal script:
    
    ```python
         import pycotech
    
         df = pycotech.utils.read_plw("my_plw_file.PLW")
         print(df)
    ```
