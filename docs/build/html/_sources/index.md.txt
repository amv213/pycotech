# 📑 Welcome to Pycotech!

Pycotech offers tools and wrappers to interface with PT-104 PicoLog® Data
 Loggers and files, allowing you to easily build an end-to-end data processing
  pipeline in pure python.
  
This work would not have been possible without **Martin Schröder**'s
 amazing wrapper around the usbpt104 c library for the Pico PT-104A RTD Data 
 Acquisition Module. Don't hesitate to head over to his 
 [PT_104 Github repo](https://github.com/trombastic/Pico_PT104) to check out
  the original project and to drop a star! 🌟

## 🔥 Features

Pycotech's suite of utility functions provides seamless integration of
 `.PLW` and `.TXT` files generated by traditional PicoTechnology® 
 software - allowing you to handle, visualise, and convert between 
 data-formats at will. 
  
Pycotech also provides python command line alternatives to most of the 
 principal PicoLog® software components. Namely, pycotech's 
 `plw-recorder` allows you to bypass the PLW Recorder® data acquisition
  software and gather data directly from a number of PT-104 Data 
  Loggers. Pycotech's `plw-player` substitutes instead the PicoLog® Player
   software, allowing you to read, convert, and extract data from existing
    `.PLW` files.
