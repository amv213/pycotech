# üéà Basic Usage

This section will guide you through core pycotech features!
 
## üìã Working with files

Pycotech's suite of utility functions provides seamless integration of
 `.PLW` and `.TXT` files generated by traditional PicoTechnology¬Æ 
 software - allowing you to handle, visualise, and convert between 
 data-formats at will. 
 
 All of these functions are offered by the `pycotech.utils` module, and
  allow you to move between one data format and the other as shown in the
   diagram below:

```{image} ./_static/file_schema.png
:alt: file schema
:width: 500px
:align: center
```

As shown above, pycotech also exposes to command line tools to convert `.PLW
` files to text, and to log data acquired interactively from PT-104 Data
 Loggers. These are `plw-player` and `plw-recorder`.
 
## üìù PLW Player

Pycotech's `plw-player` aims to offer equivalent functionalities to  the
 PicoLog¬Æ Player software, allowing you to read, convert, and extract data
  from existing `.PLW` files. 

Technically speaking, pycotech removes the need to save data in the
`.PLW` file format, given that data can be read live from the data loggers
 and converted directly to dataframes. Nonetheless, `plw-player` is still
  useful to deal with legacy `.PLW` files yet to be converted, or for those
   that prefer to keep the data acquisition through PicoLog¬Æ software but
    would like to automate the steps downstream the pipeline.

To convert `.PLW` files to `.TXT` with `plw-player`, you just need to install 
`pycotech` and then run the command line tool as follows:

```
usage: plw-player [-h] -plw PLW [-txt TXT]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -plw PLW    input .PLW file
  -txt TXT    output .TXT file
```

The utility takes as `-plw` argument the path to the `.PLW` file to convert
, and will generate a `.TXT` file whose path is given by the optional `-txt
` argument. By default, the output `.TXT` file will be generated in the
 same directory as the input `.PLW` file and be named in the same way.

For example, running the following will convert your `my_plw_file.PLW` file to
a `my_plw_file.TXT`, saved in the same directory:

```bash
$ plw-player -plw "my_plw_file.PLW"
```

## üíæ PLW Recorder

Pycotech's `plw-recorder` allows you to bypass the PLW Recorder¬Æ data
 acquisition software and gather data directly from PT-104 Data Loggers
  connected to your machine via USB. 

To start the data acquisition with `plw-recorder`, you just need to install 
`pycotech` and then run the command line tool as follows:

```
usage: plw-recorder [-h] [-dir DIR]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -dir DIR    output directory
```

The utility takes only the optional `-dir` argument, specifying the path to
 the directory in which to save logs. 

Once executed, the command line tool will scan for connected devices and ask
 for permission to launch the data acquisition.
 
In addition, user input is offered to give custom label
 identifiers to the acquisition channels from each data logger. If chosen
 , the user will need to provide interactively the identifiers for each
  acquisition device. For example, providing `P` will label the channels of
   the given data logger as `P1`, `P2`, ...
Providing custom labels is optional, and only helps maintaining consistency
 with existing data with pre-existing labels. If skipped, the channels from
  different devices will be labelled in alphabetical order.  

```{note}
Data acquired through `plw-player` has a total sample rate of 0.75 s times
 the number of active channels on the acquisition device. This means that
 when collecting data from typical PT-104 data loggers with four active
 channels per device, samples will be logged with a 3 s interval.

Keep in mind that this is slower than data acquisition through the official 
PLW Recorder¬Æ software, which is able to sample data at faster rates.
```

Finally, data is periodically batch-logged in `.TXT` files timestamped at
 the date of creation (so with the timestamp of the last log entry). For
  data sampled every 3 seconds, each log will be generated every 24 hours
  . If the script is terminated from the command line, `plw-recorder` will
   make sure that the currently running log is compiled and saved.

The following minimal example will start logging data from available data
 loggers, and save the resulting logs in a `/PycoLogs` folder in the current
  working directory:

```bash
$ plw-recorder
```
