## ðŸ“‹ Working with files

Pycotech's suite of utility functions provides seamless integration of
 `.PLW` and `.TXT` files generated by traditional PicoTechnologyÂ® 
 software - allowing you to handle, visualise, and convert between 
 data-formats at will. 
 
 All of these functions are offered by the `pycotech.utils` module, and
  allow you to move between one data format and the other as shown in the
   diagram below:
