# üéà Basic Usage

This section will guide you through core pycotech features!
 
## üìã Working with files

Pycotech's suite of utility functions provides seamless integration of
 `.PLW` and `.TXT` files generated by traditional PicoTechnology¬Æ 
 software - allowing you to handle, visualise, and convert between 
 data-formats at will. 
 
 All of these functions are offered by the `pycotech.utils` module, and
  allow you to move between one data format and the other as shown in the
   diagram below:

```{image} ./_static/file_schema.png
:alt: file schema
:width: 500px
:align: center
```

As shown above, pycotech also exposes to command line tools to convert `.PLW
` files to text, and to log data acquired interactively from PT-104 Data
 Loggers. These are `plw-player` and `plw-recorder`.
 
## üìù PLW Player

Pycotech's `plw-player` aims to offer equivalent functionalities to  the
 PicoLog¬Æ Player software, allowing you to read, convert, and extract data
  from existing `.PLW` files. 

Technically speaking, pycotech removes the need to save data in the
`.PLW` file format, given that data can be read live from the data loggers
 and converted directly to dataframes. Nonetheless, `plw-player` is still
  useful to deal with legacy `.PLW` files yet to be converted, or for those
   that prefer to keep the data acquisition through PicoLog¬Æ software but
    would like to automate the steps downstream the pipeline.

To convert `.PLW` files to `.TXT` with `plw-player`, you just need to install 
`pycotech` and then run the following from command line:

```
usage: plw-player [-h] -plw PLW [-txt TXT]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -plw PLW    input .PLW file
  -txt TXT    output .TXT file
```

The utility takes as `-plw` argument the path to the `.PLW` file to convert
, and will generate a `.TXT` file whose path is given by the optional `-txt
` argument. By default, the output `.TXT` file will be generated in the
 same directory as the input `.PLW` file and be named in the same way.

For example, running the following will convert your `my_plw_file.PLW` file to
a `my_plw_file.TXT`, saved in the same directory:

```bash
$ plw-player -plw "my_plw_file.PLW"
```
